The emotional analysis is based on the clinical model of Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and uses artificial intelligence technology (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro as the primary provider and OpenAI GPT-4o as backup, in accordance with their respective terms of service) to identify emotions, their intensity, and possible triggers.

> **IMPORTANT — AI Limitations and Mental Health Disclaimer:**

> **DayMood is NOT a medical device and does NOT provide medical or psychological diagnoses, advice, or treatment.** The emotional analysis provided by the AI is for **personal self-awareness and guidance purposes only**. The AI may produce inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent results. You should never rely on DayMood's analysis as a substitute for professional psychological or medical advice.
>
> **If you experience mental health issues, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, or any other condition, please consult a qualified mental health professional immediately.**
>
> **In case of emergency or mental health crisis, immediately contact emergency services (112 in Europe, 911 in the USA) or crisis helplines in your country.**
